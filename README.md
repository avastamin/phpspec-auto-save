# phpspec-auto-save
This is a sample php project to make test driven development(TDD) more easy and run test on file save. Here I uses [PHPSpec][1] 

### How to run this:
1. Install `composer` if it's not installed
2. go to the directory and `gulp`
3. Now if you run your file and just save you will see tests runs

Note: in this project test file located in `spec` directory and php files located in `src` directory
